# Library_Management_System

About our Library

Our task titled Library management system is a user friendly website where a person can check the availability of the books in the library.We wanted to mimic a physical library so if the user wants a book then he/she need to go to the library and there the admin would handle the transaction. We used HTML, CSS and JavaScript in frontend languages ,SQL and PHP in backend languages for our task.

The website begins with a login page where a person can enter his/her details to log in. If he/she is an admin, he/she will be directed to the admin page where they can monitor adding books and issuing them. And if the person is a user they are directed to the user page where they can search for the available books. There is a history page for the user where he/she can find the details of the books which they have returned earlier.There is also a Profile page where they can see the details of books which are presently issued to them.In users page, users can search for books through the website’s search option.They can check its availability by seeing the number of copies available.

The admin page is accessible only to specific people.Admin can add books and can look after all the monitoring process in aspect of issue, reissue and returning books of users. Admin will be alerted while issuing,retuning process if the user has exceeded a book limit of 4 or if the user has already taken the same copy of book before. Otherwise he will be given books accordingly and alerted in that case too.
We also put an icon for our website which will be displayed in the tab bar.

If the user wants to know more about website's functionalities, we have an informative "About" page. It provides a detailed explanation of each feature and how to use them.
